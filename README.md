# Virtual Instrument for the Visually Impaired

VIVI is a software synthesiser based on use of exported MAX MSP Gen~ code into C++ using the JUCE Framework
6.1 update to create a user interface that is accessible for Visually Impaired Music Makers. This will be 
documented in detail as part for my Bsc Music Technology degree, and will be made open source after indentifying
pitfalls for the project.
